# Gradient Works Machine Learning Interview Repo

Hello friends! If you're reading this, you're probably interviewing for a machine learning position at Gradient Works. If not, GET OUT! SHOO! Go on now, git!

Just kidding, you can hang out. But you're probably not going to get much out of this repo. Maybe you will, who knows? I'm not your mom.

Anyway, if you're here for the interview, welcome! I'll outline the steps for the whole process here and if you have any questions, send an email to mando@gradient.works and he'll clear things up.

## Step 1: Phone screen

You've probably already done this, but if not, we'll schedule a 30-minute phone call so we can get to know each other. We'll chat about your background and experience, and we'll also talk about Gradient Works, the role and what you're looking for in your next job. If everything is a good fit, we'll move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Technical exercise

We'll send you a technical exercise to complete. It's a Jupyter notebook that you can run in your own environment or in Google Colab, plus a tiny CSV dataset. The exercise will test your ability to explore data, answer questions about that data, and build a small RAG system to answer arbitrary questions abou the data.

We expect the exercise to take 1-3 hours, depending on how far you take the RAG system. We're not looking for a perfect solution, but we are looking for a thoughtful approach and a good understanding of the approach (there's more detail in the notebook).

You can find the exercise [here](./exercise.ipynb).

To complete the exercise, you can either:

1. fork the repo and submit a pull request with your solution, or
2. import the notebook into your own Google Colab environment and share the notebook with @mando

If neither of those work, email mando@gradient.works and we'll figure something out.

> If possible, we'd like to invite you into our Slack while you're working on the exercise. This way, you can ask questions and we can get to know each other a bit better. If you're interested, let us know and we'll send you an invite.

> You might be asking yourself, "Doesn't this dummy know that I can just look at the notebook and get started early?". And yeah, I get it. But the whole point of this is for you to demonstrate your abilities and level of understanding. So, if you spend a bunch of time learning all the ins and outs of RAG systems ahead of time, well, I mean that's great for us :).

Once you've completed the exercise, we'll review it and schedule a Zoom interview to discuss your solution.

## Step 3: Zoom interview

We'll schedule a 1.5-hour Zoom interview to discuss your solution to the technical exercise. We'll ask you to walk us through your approach, explain your code, how you might extend the solution, etc. We'll also make sure to leave plenty of time for you to ask us questions about the team, the company, and what we're building and how.

After that, we'll make a decision and let you know as soon as possible.

## Step 4: There's no Step 4

Hopefully this all makes sense and you're excited to get started. Interviewing is hard and we get that. We hope that this process makes sense and is as stress-free as it can be.
