# Gradient Works Machine Learning Interview Repo

Hello friends! You're probably most interested in the actual [exercise](./exercise.ipynb) - that's got all the instructions and data you'll need to get started. The last thing you'll need is an OpenAI key, which @mando should have already given you. If not, he's a lazy bum and you should bug him about it.

To complete the exercise, you can either:

1. fork the repo and submit a pull request with your solution, or
2. import the notebook into your own Google Colab environment and share the notebook with @mando

If neither of those work, email @mando and we'll figure something out.
